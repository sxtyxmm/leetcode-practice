# Intuition
## The problem appears to involve maximizing the number of cherries collected by two robots moving simultaneously on a grid.
## Since the robots can move in any of the three directions (left, right, or stay in the same column), dynamic programming 
## seems like a suitable approach to efficiently explore all possible paths and optimize the cherry collection.

# Approach
## The approach involves defining a recursive function that explores all possible paths for the two robots while keeping 
## track of the maximum cherries collected. We utilize memoization to avoid redundant calculations. At each step, we calculate
## the cherries collected by both robots and recursively explore all valid next moves. The maximum cherries collected at each 
## step are memoized to avoid recalculating the same state.

# Complexity
## - Time complexity: 
##  - The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach is typically exponential due to the recursive exploration of all
## possible paths. However, with memoization, the time complexity becomes more manageable, approximately O(n^3), where n is the 
## number of rows or columns in the grid.
## - Space complexity: 
##  - The space complexity is O(n^3) due to the memoization array, which stores the results of already computed states.
